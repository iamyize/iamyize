## Hi :)

I am Yize (isa is just perfectly fine). 

âœ¨ I am currently a PhD student at the National University of Singapore. I also completed my bachelor here a while ago. 

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m working on several projects in HCI and accessibility, though Iâ€™ve admittedly procrastinated on cleaning up code and open-sourcing a few of them. 

ðŸŒ± A personal website is also on my to-do list, so stay tuned. 



Thanks for stopping by, and have a great day ahead! ðŸ˜Š
