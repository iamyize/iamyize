## Hi :)

I am Yize (isa is just perfectly fine!) and I am currently a PhD student at the National University of Singapore. I also completed my bachelor here a while ago. 

💻 I’m working on several projects in HCI and accessibility, though I’ve admittedly procrastinated on cleaning up code and open-sourcing a few of them. 

🌱 A personal website is also on my to-do list, so stay tuned.

Thanks for stopping by, and have a great day ahead! 😊
