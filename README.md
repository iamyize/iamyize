## Hi :)

I am Yize è¡£æ³½ (Isa is just perfectly fine!) and I am currently a PhD student at the National University of Singapore. I also completed my bachelor here a while ago. 

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m working on several projects in HCI and accessibility, though Iâ€™ll admit, some of my code is still waiting to be cleaned up and open-sourced! 

ðŸŒ± A personal website is also on my to-do list, so stay tuned.

Thanks for stopping by, and have a great day ahead! ðŸ˜Š
