## Hi :)

I am Yize (isa is just perfectly fine). 

âœ¨ I am currently a PhD student at the National University of Singapore.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m working on several projects in HCI and accessibility, though Iâ€™ve  procrastinated on cleaning up code and open-sourcing a few of them. 

ðŸŒ± More about me can be found at: https://yizewei.vercel.app/

Thanks for stopping by, and have a great day ahead! ðŸ˜Š
